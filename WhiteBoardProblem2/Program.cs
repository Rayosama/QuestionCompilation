             * Given the mapping a=1, b=2, .... z=26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded
             * 
             * For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could dbe decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'
             * 
             * You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.
